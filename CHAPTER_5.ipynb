If this divides list is in a sorted state, you can merge the two divided lists in a sorted state again. We have to recursively sort the divided list.\n","\n","- An unsorted list divided into two can be divided into two and merged into a sorted list. Since the divided list is not sorted yet, the recursive call continues.\n","\n","- dividing a two-element list results in a one-element list. In this case, since a list with one element is a sorted list, the lists can be merged again in a sorted state.\n","\n","- Merging one-element lists creates a two-element ordered list.\n","\n","- Merging two-element lists creates a four-element sorted list.\n","\n","- Merging a four-element list creates an eight-element sorted list.\n","\n","- Find a method to merge two sorted lists into one sorted list. Use a balance scale.\n","\n","## Merging Two sorted Lists\n","\n","- First, take the smallest element of the two sorted lists one by one and compare them. In this case, since 10 is less than 13, 10 is added to the sorted list first.\n","\n","- Remove the element sent to the sorted list and compare the next element. Since 12 is less than 13, 12 is added to the sorted list.\n","\n","- Remove the element sent to the sorted list and compare the next element.
